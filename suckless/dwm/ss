mmaatthh [(--ss | ----ssccaallee) _N] [(--bb | ----bbaassee) _B_A_S_E] _E_X_P_R_E_S_S_I_O_N ...

mmaatthh  performs  mathematical calculations.  It supports simple operations such as addition, subtraction, and so
on, as well as functions like aabbss(()), ssqqrrtt(()) and llnn(()).

By default, the output shows up to 6 decimal places.  To change the number of decimal places, use  the  ----ssccaallee
option, including ----ssccaallee==00 for integer output.  Trailing zeroes will always be trimmed.

Keep in mind that parameter expansion happens before expressions are evaluated.  This can be very useful in or‐
der to perform calculations involving shell variables or the output of command substitutions, but it also means
that  parenthesis ((())) and the asterisk (**) glob character have to be escaped or quoted.  xx can also be used to
denote multiplication, but it needs to be followed by whitespace to distinguish it from hexadecimal numbers.

Parentheses for functions are optional - mmaatthh ssiinn ppii prints 00.  However, a comma will bind to the  inner  func‐
tion,  so mmaatthh ppooww ssiinn 33,, 55 is an error because it tries to give ssiinn the arguments 33 and 55.  When in doubt, use
parentheses.

mmaatthh ignores whitespace between arguments and takes its input as multiple arguments (internally joined  with  a
space), so mmaatthh 22 ++22 and mmaatthh ""22 ++    22"" work the same.  mmaatthh 22 22 is an error.

The following options are available:

--ss _N or ----ssccaallee _N
       Sets the scale of the result.  NN must be an integer or the word "max" for the maximum scale.  A scale of
       zero  causes results to be truncated, not rounded. Any non-integer component is thrown away.  So 33//22 re‐
       turns 11 rather than 22 which 11..55 would normally round to.  This is for compatibility with  bbcc  which  was
       the  basis for this command prior to fish 3.0.0.  Scale values greater than zero causes the result to be
       rounded using the usual rules to the specified number of decimal places.

--bb _B_A_S_E or ----bbaassee _B_A_S_E
       Sets the numeric base used for output (mmaatthh always understands hexadecimal numbers as input).   It  cur‐
       rently  understands  "hex" or "16" for hexadecimal and "octal" or "8" for octal and implies a scale of 0
       (other scales cause an error), so it will truncate the result down to an integer.  This might change  in
       the  future.   Hex  numbers will be printed with a 00xx prefix.  Octal numbers will have a prefix of 00 but
       aren't understood by mmaatthh as input.

--hh or ----hheellpp
       Displays help about using this command.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
If the expression is successfully evaluated and doesn't over/underflow or return NaN the return ssttaattuuss is  zero
(success) else one.

SSYYNNTTAAXX
mmaatthh knows some operators, constants, functions and can (obviously) read numbers.

For  numbers,  .. is always the radix character regardless of locale - 22..55, not 22,,55.  Scientific notation (1100ee55)
and hexadecimal (00xxFFFF) are also available.

mmaatthh allows you to use underscores as visual  separators  for  digit  grouping.  For  example,  you  can  write
11__000000__000000, 00xx__8899__AABB__CCDD__EEFF, and 11..223344__556677__ee8899.

OOPPEERRAATTOORRSS
mmaatthh knows the following operators:

++      for addition

--      for subtraction

** oorr xx for multiplication. ** is the glob character and needs to be quoted or escaped, xx needs to be followed by
       whitespace or it looks like 00xx hexadecimal notation.

//      for division

^^      for exponentiation

%%      for modulo

(( oorr )) for grouping. These need to be quoted or escaped because (()) denotes a command substitution.

They are all used in an infix manner - 55 ++ 22, not ++ 55 22.

CCOONNSSTTAANNTTSS
mmaatthh knows the following constants:

ee      Euler's number

ppii     π, you know this one.  Half of Tau

ttaauu    Equivalent to 2π, or the number of radians in a circle

Use them without a leading $$ - ppii -- 33 should be about 0.

FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS
mmaatthh supports the following functions:

aabbss    the absolute value, with positive sign

aaccooss   arc cosine

aassiinn   arc sine

aattaann   arc tangent

aattaann22  arc tangent of two variables

bbiittaanndd,, bbiittoorr aanndd bbiittxxoorr
       perform  bitwise  operations.   These will throw away any non-integer parts and interpret the rest as an
       int.

       Note: bbiittnnoott and bbiittnnaanndd don't exist. This is because numbers in math don't really have a _w_i_d_t_h in terms
       of bits, and these operations necessarily care about leading zeroes.

       If you need to negate a specific number you can do it with an xor with a mask, e.g.:

          > math --base=hex bitxor 0x0F, 0xFF
          0xF0

          > math --base=hex bitxor 0x2, 0x3
          # Here we mask with 0x3 == 0b111, so our number is 3 bits wide
          # Only the 1 bit isn't set.
          0x1

cceeiill   round number up to the nearest integer

ccooss    the cosine

ccoosshh   hyperbolic cosine

eexxpp    the base-e exponential function

ffaacc    factorial - also known as xx!! (xx ** ((xx -- 11)) ** ((xx -- 22)) ** ...... ** 11)

fflloooorr  round number down to the nearest integer

llnn     the base-e logarithm

lloogg oorr lloogg1100
       the base-10 logarithm

lloogg22   the base-2 logarithm

mmaaxx    returns the largest of the given numbers - this takes an arbitrary number of  arguments  (but  at  least
       one)

mmiinn    returns  the  smallest  of the given numbers - this takes an arbitrary number of arguments (but at least
       one)

nnccrr    "from n choose r" combination function - how many subsets of size r can be taken from n  (order  doesn't
       matter)

nnpprr    the number of subsets of size r that can be taken from a set of n elements (including different order)

ppooww((xx,,yy))
       returns x to the y (and can be written as xx ^^ yy)

rroouunndd  rounds to the nearest integer, away from 0

ssiinn    the sine function

ssiinnhh   the hyperbolic sine

ttaann    the tangent

ttaannhh   the hyperbolic tangent

All of the trigonometric functions use radians (the pi-based scale, not 360°).

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY NNOOTTEESS
Fish 1.x and 2.x releases relied on the bbcc command for handling mmaatthh expressions. Starting with fish 3.0.0 fish
uses the tinyexpr library and evaluates the expression without the involvement of any external commands.

You  don't  need  to use ---- before the expression, even if it begins with a minus sign which might otherwise be
interpreted as an invalid option. If you do insert ---- before the expression, it will cause option  scanning  to
stop just like for every other command and it won't be part of the expression.
